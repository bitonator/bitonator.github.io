I am a full-stack developer now, I was a graphics and game developer 5 years back.

I am a nomad at heart, love remote work, enjoy music, food and finding unique shoes.

I love startups, especially bootstrappers.

I run [Radio Flote](http://radioflote.com) with money from my projects and money musicians pay us to help with their visibility.

Stuff I've enjoyed coding:

- Business Phone feature for [Call Hub](https://callhub.io)
- Http Live Streaming client on javascript based on [aurora.js](https://github.com/audiocogs/aurora.js/)
- Scrimmage Scramble for NFL Rushzone via Brandissimo
- [Iron Grip - The Oppression](http://www.moddb.com/mods/iron-grip-the-oppression), an award-winning Half Life 2 Mod
- A tool to automatically pull out individual comic images from scans of comic pages
- A Maya plugin which allowed duplicated mesh parts to be used as targets for blending meshes
- FEX or Fast Expressions, a Maya tool which converted scripted expressions to node graphs for speed

I interview musicians and write articles about them at [Stories In Music](https://medium.com/stories-in-music).
