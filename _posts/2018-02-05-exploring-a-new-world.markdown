excerpt: Work conveniently on multiple projects by isolating project environments within chroot jails

I've spent 16 years developing interesting stuff. When I first started hunting for a job, I couldn't get myself to apply in all the typical corporate jobs, so I joined an animation studio, and together with a team of 10 people, we created a computer graphics pipeline that brought down episode delivery times from 1 year to 6 weeks. The result was the Little Krishna series, which is a fun and popular watch for kids in India.

However, I've always met with resistance in the way I work. The thing is that internally, I always see myself as committing to projects, and not jobs. I feel being tied to a job forever limits my ability to serve people better. I always approach a project with the sole aim of finishing it as fast as possible and moving on. While this does put pressure on me to perform, it also keeps me in top shape, making me disrupt myself ever so often.

Deep down, I really want to unshackle myself from the concept of a job. And as part of that effort, I'm doing two things - experimenting with a few simple products I've built and switching from job mode to consultancy mode. I have a couple of consulting gigs, but I really want to push the edge on this one and find projects that the best of the best are doing.

Thats why I'm registering for [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com). I know its crazy that they select only 3% of the applicants, but I'm hoping that the amount I've disrupted myself so far gets me through the qualification for them. 

I strongly believe that the world is in the threshold of fundamental changes in the way we communicate, work and engage.

Borders are becoming less and less important and overall skill and value are gaining more importance everyday.

As a person who worked hard on my skills and someone who's never stopped learning new things. I'm very keen on working on challenges that can really use my potiental to the fullest.

I really hope that I make it through to [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com), I'm preparing hard for it, fingers crossed, wish me luck!
